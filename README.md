Heart of DevOps - CI/CD

Tool
Jenkins ( https://www.jenkins.io/download/ ) Pipeline as Code
GitLab CI ( https://about.gitlab.com/install/ )
GitHub Actions ( https://github.com/actions )

Automated Release Pipeline

Merge code changes
Remote git repository
Tests
Build the application
Application Scans
Artifact repository
Deploy 

Integration Capabilities 
Git ( https://git-scm.com/downloads )
Docker Registry ( https://docs.docker.com/ )
Cloud Platforms (

Applications Access
Configure Server 
Security Groups
Virtual Servers

Testing Tools
Pipeline as Code

AWS Virtual Machine ( Hosting an Application )

How is the app packaged ?
How does it run on the end environment ?
Docker 
https://docs.docker.com/ 
Cri-o
https://cri-o.io/
Container(d)
https://containerd.io/downloads/ 

Standardized units called “containers”
Containers have everything the software needs to run package inside (

Libraries 
System tools
Code
Run time 

CI/CD
Docker Image ( https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/images/ )
Docker Repository ( https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/create/ )
Deploy and Run as Docker Container
Docker run AWS Server
Container Orchestration Platform
Kubernetes ( 
https://kubernetes.io/releases/download/ 
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/ 

Kubernetes Cluster

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata
       name: myapp-deployment 
…
spec:
       replicas: 8
       …
              spec:
                     containers:
                     - name: myapp
                     image:myapp:1.14.2
                     ports: 
containerPort: 80

This Becomes a monitoring challenge 
Proper Monitoring and 
Alerting System ( Prometheus - https://prometheus.io/download/ )
Infrastructure
Runtime 
Application
Prometheus Server ( Gather metrics )
AlertManager ( Notify )
Grafana ( Visualization and Dashboards - https://grafana.com/grafana/download ) 

Infrastructure as Code
Terraform 
https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads 
Infrastructure resources in code files
Automates the creation, configuration and management of infrastructure resources 

Configuration Management 
Ansible ( https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html )
Configuration as Code
Linux 
Installing Packages
Security patches 
Ansible 
Write script once ( Playbook )
Provide target servers ( Inventory )


Visual Studio Code 
Plugins ( Auto-Completion, Detect problems in code, Syntax Highlighting, … )
Jenkins ( Pipeline as Code )
Dockerfile
Kubernetes Manifest
Terraform ( Infrastructure as Code )
Ansible ( Configuration as Code )
Git ( https://git-scm.com/downloads )
History of Changes 
CI/CD Infrastructure as Code
Track Infrastructure changes
Compare versions, revert changes easily 
Pipeline: Automate testing and deployment of infrastructure configurations
Code reviews, approval workflows, etc…

Linux ( https://www.linux.org/pages/download/ )
Docker Images are mostly based on Linux OS
Kubernetes Worker Nodes are Linux Servers 
Physical or cloud servers are mostly Linux OS
Working with CLI
Linux File System
Users and Permissions
Networking and Security
